# What the heck?
_In last week's episode of Baking Bad..._

This is a repo to gather baking recipes (and even recipes that are not baking,
who cares, really, in these times of uncertainty)

## Recipes

* [Sourdough pitta](recipes/sourdough-pitta/sourdough_pitta.md) (by [sholgz](https://github.com/sholgz))
* [tomchop's sourdough bread](recipes/tomchops-attempt-at-sourdough/recipe.md) (by [tomchop](https://github.com/tomchop))

# I want to add a new recipe

Just fork the repo, add a directory in in `/recipes`, add a link to it from the
`Recipes` section here and send a pull request! Feel free to include images,
guides, links to other websites or recipes.

# What recipes are you looking for?

Take a look at the open [issues](https://github.com/tomchop/bakingbad/issues).

# I have an idea that would make this idea less stupid

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/tomchop/bakingbad/issues/new), nothing
 is fixed, everything can change.

# Will there be a nicer website than just markdown files?

Yes. Soon. I promise. Maybe.
